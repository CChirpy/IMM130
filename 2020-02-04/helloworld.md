===== HOME INFO ======

// Home page Headline:
Colonizing Humans within the Sol System

// Photo of solar system: 

// Intro Paragraph:
Early settlers who came to the U.S. almost 400 years ago had game to shoot, plants to raise and topsoil on which to grow crops. But we will have to bring everything to Mars ourselves. 


// Sub headline: 
The Cost of the Move

// Sub paragraph:
Thatâ€™s why cost is so important and why we want robots to build things, genetically engineered crops to thrive in that environment, and nanotechnology to create lightweight, super-strong building materials that are pre-fabricated to create dome cities.


// Teaser Worlds
* Earth: The original. We already have Streetview.
* Mars: Sure, why not? 4th Rock from the Sun.
* Europa: As the sun gets hotter, Jupiter gets stonger.
* Titan: If not a moon of Saturn, then where?

// Intro pragraph
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.

As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize thereâ€™s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.

// Sub Headline
Problems look mighty small from 4 zillion miles away.

You know, being a test pilot isn't always the healthiest business in the world. It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.

Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.
