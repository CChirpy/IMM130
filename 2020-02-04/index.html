    <h1>Colonizing Humans within the Sol System</h1>
    <!--Photo of the solar sytem:-->

    <p>Early settlers who came to the U.S. almost 400 years ago had game to shoot, plants to raise and topsoil on which to grow crops. But we will have to bring everything to Mars ourselves.</p>

    <h2>The Cost of the Move</h2>
    <p>That's why cost is so important and why we want robots to build things, genetically engineered crops to thrive in that environment, and nanotechnology to create lightweight, super-strong building materials that are pre-fabricated to create dome cities.</p>

    <h3>Earth</h3>
    <p>The original. We already have Streetview.</p>

    <h3>Mars</h3>
    <p>Sure, why not? 4th Rock from the Sun.</p>

    <h3>Europa</h3>
    <p>As the sun gets hotter, Jupiter gets stonger.</p>

    <h3>Titan</h3>
    <p>If not a moon of Saturn, then where?</p>
