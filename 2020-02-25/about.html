            <p class="intro">"We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win."</p>

            <h2>Problems look mighty small from 4 zillion miles away.</h2>
            <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize thereâ€™s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore . . . and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
            <p>You know, being a test pilot isn't always the healthiest business in the world. It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.</p>
            <p>Astronomy compels the soul to look upward, and leads us from this world to another.</p>
